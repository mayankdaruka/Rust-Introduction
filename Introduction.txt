Goal of Rust is to be good programming language for creating highly concurrent, safe and performant systems.

3 main goals:
 - safety
 - speed
 - concurrency

It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.

It also brings contemporary developer tools to the systems programming world:
 - Cargo, an included dependency manager and build tool. It handles a lot of tasks for you including building your code, downlaoding the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries
 - Rustfmt, a formatting tool that ensures a consistent coding style across developers
 - Rust Language Server powers IDE integration for code completion and inline error messages

I will follow the Rust Programming Language book in order to learn the workings of Rust.
